    <p class="blog-style"> A few years back, during a hot summer day,A few years back, during a hot summer day, he left
        the library feeling
        sad and mundane. He placed his black Christmas-themed bookmark back in the 'Eleanor and Park' hardcover and
        planned to continue reading it the next time sun and clouds aligned as perfectly as that day. </p>

    <p class="blog-style"> Once he crossed the roads, he thought about the curly-haired guy with an oval-shaped face in
        the same building.
        He didn't know the guy's name so he named him Simon in his scenarios. And how everyone always loved him. And how
        he always wore clothes with so many colors. And the only dull-colored piece of cloth he ever owned was that
        faded grey sweater which he only wore on days that rained like hell. And how he always chose to wore beige khaki
        pants with it and his white Vans. And how he always checked his watch every now and then like the world was
        ending one second a time and he had to make sure he was making the most out of it. </p>


    <p class="blog-style">
        He always wanted to talk to Simon or at least maybe ask him what the time is so he could see the serious bright
        look on Simon's face that appeared every time he looked at the watch. The only time they exchanged words was
        when Simon asked him to turn on the corner fan in the library. He acted like an idiot for two seconds because
        Simon's voice was sweet as they were in his scenarios.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-style">
        On another fine day on which clouds appeared damp and little miniature plants sprout out of wall's surfaces, he
        heard the unsettling news that a pretty girl in the same building bought a silver ring for Simon. Although they
        were all 17 and he never understood what was the need for a ring. All he ever wanted was to ask Simon what the
        time was. </p>

    <p class="blog-style">

        It never rained that day but he was sad and walked at a pace of a three-toed sloth and he missed his bus but was
        surprised to see Simon still standing there. He didn't want to see Simon's white-red face so he dipped his face
        into the cold steel handrails of the bus stop. It smelled of rust and that's when he noticed that the ring
        wasn't there on Simon's hand. </p>
    <p class="blog-style">

        He saw his bus arriving from the last turn and felt this sudden and overwhelming urge that the world was ending
        one second at a time and he had to make the most out of it. And that's when he asked, "Hey Simon, What's the
        time?" </p>
